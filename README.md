# Non-Interactive Twitter-Login-Clone Using HTML5 + CSS3

# Description
This is a small project which outlines my basic knowledge of HTML5 and CSS3. The project in this repository is an attempted replica of the twitter login page, it includes every button within the page, all the mark-up text at the bottom and more. HTML5 and CSS were used for this project because it outlines the simplicity of the webpages development and ensures that i can convey my knowledge within code. During this projects i had faced a couple challenges. A main issue what i ran into was getting the exact colour of the twitter buttons as i wanted this clone to look alike. So what i did to overcome this issue was to inspect the main twitter's login page, select the button elemtn within it's defined div, and from there go into the computed tab of inspect to find it's exact RGB values. A further issue which i faced was including the logos within the buttons. This was fixed with a simple search which lead me to W3schools, this outlined that i can use an <img> element within a <button> element.

# Usage Of Project
To use and view this project i recommend using VS Code (Visual Studio Code) to load the files and link all of the CSS together. From there onwards, you can download an extension in VS Code known as Live Preview which is designed by Microsoft. This then allows you to view the live website within the IDE via clicking: ![image](https://github.com/TPlatts04/Twitter-Login-Clone/assets/67462990/86878a4a-6aee-4184-abc3-f67a0ea877e9) image this small button (highlighted in red) in line with the file name. Alternatively you can run this project in a web browser by downloading an extension in VS Code known as Live Server, where then you can right-click in any area of code and click 'Open with Live Server'. You will need to ensure that all of the program files are in the same parent folder otherwise the CSS will not link to the main HTML file.
